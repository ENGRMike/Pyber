# Pyber

Observations:

1) Urban drivers are the only drivers that experience a less than 1 ratio of average fare to drives. This means that Urban drivers make less on average per ride than their counterparts.
2) Suburban drivers account for 19.1% of all drivers but account for 27.3% of all total rides. When we look at the ratio of rides to drivers by location type we see that Urban drivers have lowest ratio, 0.87 while rural drivers have the highest, 1.68, meaning rural drivers have almost twice the rides as urban drivers. 
3) When comparing the rides by city type to the fare again we see the suburban and rural drivers making more per ride than their urban counterpart. However here we see that the suburban driver makes more per ride on average than the rural driver. 

Conclusion:
Urban drivers make up a vast majority of all Pyber drivers however because of this they drive less and for less of the average total fare amongst all drivers. Suburban drivers are the best off, they have a high amount of rides per driver, and also have a higher average price per ride.
